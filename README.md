## Instructions

When first loading the page, there will already be some moves made; this is simply to make it very obvious that you are about to play a memory game by matching cards, instead of only seeing the blank backs of cards.

Click on any card, and you will receive a pop-up asking if you would like to start playing. If you select "OK" the board will clear, and the card you initially selected will turn over, revealing its icon, and the timer will start.

From this point, simply click the next card you would like to reveal. If the icons match, the cards will remain "turned over" - but if the cards DO NOT match, remember what they were! They will turn back over, hiding the icons. You can then select another set of cards to try to match them.

Each two cards flipped will increase the "moves" counter by 1. If you can match all the cards in less than 16 moves, you will win the game with all 3 stars remaining. If you can do it in fewer than 24 moves, you'll have 2 stars remaining.

Once all 16 cards have been matched - you win! You will receive a pop-up congratulations, advising how many moves it took you to win, how many stars you have, and the amount of time it took for you to match all the cards in the deck.

## Purpose

This was built as a project toward completing a Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree. The goal was to build a version of "Concentration" using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Resources

The application was built using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* FontAwesome (<a href="http://fontawesome.com">http://fontawesome.com</a>)

Additionally, I absolutely could not have completed it without substantial assitance and research using the following sites:
* W3 Schools Online Web Tutorials (<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">https://www.w3schools.com/</a>)
* Stack Overflow (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">https://stackoverflow.com/</a>)
* Mozilla Developer Network - JavaScript Knowledge Base (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript</a>)
* Udacity - both the teachers and the other students (<a href="http://udacity.com">http://udacity.com</a>)

## Browser Compatibilities

Built and tested in Chrome. Once "complete" (as if any development is ever truly complete...), tested in Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

Additional testing was done using the Chrome App on an android device, as well as in Safari on an iOS device.

## Author

Andrew Hartley (I won't take credit for the HTML and CSS - for the most part that was provided by Udacity, though I made a few small changes. Ditto for the CSS. The Javascript, however, was pretty much all me, with the exception of the shuffle function.)

## Credits

If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a World Wide Web to create a working app.

As stated above in the Resources section, there are lots of places I went to track down the multitude of things that didn't work the first time I tried.

Specifically, though, two "tutorial" videos I watched made a huge difference in giving the courage and confidence to even start this project:

* Mike Wales, Udacity Content Developer
  * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y">FEND EMEA Memory Game Webinar</a>

* Ryan Waite, Udacity Project Coach

## Contributing

This was built as a project toward completing a Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree. I will consider pull requests, but most likely will simply continue to experiment with all I learn here, as well as getting better using Git and Github.
